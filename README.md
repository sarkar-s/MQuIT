Measurement Quality using Information Theory

MQuIT uses information theory to quantify the quality of single-cell transcript and protein expression measurements. The single-cell transcript(m) or protein (g) data is used to compute the empirical conditional distributions, P(m|X) or P(g|X), where X is the value of the input, e.g. lactose concentration. The conditional distributions for a set of input values is then used to compute the maximum mutual information or the channel capacity in bits/response.
